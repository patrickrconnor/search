Caterpillars, not to be confused with the bug, are a type of 
[[excavation machinery]] characterized by having two horizontal treads and a 
long scoop. Caterpillars are typically colored yellow. They are often used in 
[[Jobs: Construction]] because of their versatility in their ability to 
excavate. Caterpillars utilize their yellow arm, which has a claw attached to 
it, to dig up [[earth | Soil ]].
